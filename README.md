# Fedora LAMP DEV Manager Script 🚀

This script provides an interactive way to install and manage a developer-focused LAMP stack (Apache, MariaDB, PHP-FPM) on Fedora 43, optimized for workflows like PrestaShop and other PHP apps. It includes VHost automation, SSL (Let’s Encrypt + self-signed), repeatable permissions (ACL + SELinux), backups/restores, and live log tailing. 🧰

---

## Quick Start ⚡

1) Place the script somewhere convenient (example: `~/Downloads/lamp-setup.sh`) and run:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x lamp-setup.sh
./lamp-setup.sh | tee lamp-log.txt
````

📝 Logs will be written to `lamp-log.txt`.

## What It Installs and Configures 🧱

### Apache + PHP-FPM (Fedora repositories) 🌐

* Apache HTTPD with HTTP/2 and SSL modules (`mod_http2`, `mod_ssl`) 🔒
* PHP-FPM using a Unix socket (`/run/php-fpm/www.sock`) 🔌
* Ensures required Apache proxy modules for PHP-FPM (`mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_fcgi`) ✅
* PrestaShop-friendly PHP extensions:

  * `mysqlnd/mysqli`, `zip`, `intl`, `mbstring`, `curl`, `xml`, `gd`, `bcmath`, `opcache` 🧩
* Enables and starts services at boot (`httpd`, `php-fpm`) 🔁
* Opens firewall services: HTTP/HTTPS (if firewalld is available) 🛡️

### MariaDB (DEV mode) 🗄️

* Installs and enables MariaDB ✅
* Configures MariaDB to listen on `0.0.0.0` (remote access enabled) 🌍
* Opens firewall port `3306/tcp` (if firewalld is available) 🔓

⚠️ Warning: Remote DB access from any IP is a security risk. This is intended for development workflows only.

---

## Permissions Model (Designed for Dev) 🔐

Permissions are applied only inside `/var/www/html` (and subfolders). Your personal files are not affected. 🙌

The script applies:

* `root:apache` ownership on `/var/www/html` 👥
* setgid on directories so new folders inherit group `apache` 🧬
* default ACLs so both your user and Apache can read/write/delete content ✅
* SELinux context for writable web content: `httpd_sys_rw_content_t` (when SELinux is enabled) 🧷
* systemd `UMask=0002` for `httpd` and `php-fpm` so service-created files remain group-writable ⚙️

---

## VHosts Management 🧭

### Create project VHost 🏗️

* Creates a vhost config under `/etc/httpd/conf.d/20-<domain>.conf`
* Creates the project docroot under `/var/www/html/<folder>`
* Optionally adds a local `/etc/hosts` entry (`127.0.0.1 domain`) for local-only testing 🖥️
* Applies permissions to the new project folder 🔧

### VHost selection 🎯

Several operations use a selector that reads the vhost files created by the script.

---

## SSL Features 🔒✨

### Self-signed SSL (Local/Internal Testing) 🧪

* Generates a self-signed certificate per domain:

  * certs: `/etc/pki/tls/certs`
  * keys: `/etc/pki/tls/private`
* Appends a `:443` vhost block to the selected vhost config if it doesn’t already exist
* Enables HTTP/2 on the SSL vhost ⚡

### Let’s Encrypt SSL (Public subdomains / Client preview) 🌍✅

* Uses `certbot` with the Apache plugin to issue and install certificates automatically 🤖
* Supports HTTP → HTTPS redirect 🔁

Prerequisites 🧾:

* The domain must resolve publicly (DNS A/AAAA) to your public IP 🌐
* Port `80` must be reachable from the internet (NAT/port forward if needed) 🚪

---

## Backup and Restore 💾♻️

### Backup project 📦

Backups are created under:

* `~/lamp_backups/<domain>_<timestamp>/`

Includes:

* `files.zip` containing only the docroot contents (safe to restore into any vhost) 🗂️
* optional `db.sql` export (if you provide DB name and credentials) 🧾
* `meta.txt` with domain/docroot/timestamp 🏷️

### Smart Restore 🧠

* Lists backups inside `~/lamp_backups/` 📚
* Lets you pick a backup and choose a destination vhost 🎯
* Replaces destination docroot contents, then restores DB if `db.sql` exists 🔄
* Re-applies permissions after restoring 🔧

---

## Live Log Tailer 👀

* Select a vhost and tail the corresponding Apache error log:

  * `/var/log/httpd/<domain>_error.log`
* Shows last 20 lines and follows live output (`tail -f`) 🧵

---

## Requirements ✅

* Fedora 43 (recommended/target) 🐧
* `sudo` privileges 🔑
* Internet access (dnf installs, certbot, etc.) 🌐
* SELinux supported (works in Enforcing; script applies contexts/booleans where needed) 🧷
* firewalld recommended (script automatically opens required ports/services when present) 🛡️

## Recommendations 💡

* Run option 1 once on a fresh machine 🆕
* For each new project:

  1. Create a vhost (option 2) 🏗️
  2. Deploy PrestaShop/app into the project docroot 📂
  3. Create DB/user via your preferred method (MariaDB remote is enabled by default) 🗄️
  4. Use Let’s Encrypt (option 4) if the subdomain is publicly reachable 🌍✅
* Use Backup/Restore (options 5 and 7) before major upgrades, module installs, or content migrations 💾♻️

---

## Tested Environment 🧪

* Fedora 43 🐧
* SELinux: Enforcing 🧷
* firewalld enabled 🛡️
* Apache httpd + PHP-FPM + MariaDB from Fedora repos ✅
